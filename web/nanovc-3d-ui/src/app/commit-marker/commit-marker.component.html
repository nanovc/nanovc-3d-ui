  Sphere:
  https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/SphereGeometry
  radius — sphere radius. Default is 1.
  widthSegments — number of horizontal segments. Minimum value is 3, and the default is 32.
  heightSegments — number of vertical segments. Minimum value is 2, and the default is 16.
  phiStart — specify horizontal starting angle. Default is 0.
  phiLength — specify horizontal sweep angle size. Default is Math.PI * 2.
  thetaStart — specify vertical starting angle. Default is 0.
  thetaLength — specify vertical sweep angle size. Default is Math.PI.
  The geometry is created by sweeping and calculating vertexes around the Y axis (horizontal sweep) and the Z axis (vertical sweep).
  Thus, incomplete spheres (akin to 'sphere slices') can be created through the use of different values of phiStart, phiLength, thetaStart and thetaLength,
  in order to define the points in which we start (or end) calculating those vertices.

  Cylinder:
  https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry
  radiusTop — Radius of the cylinder at the top. Default is 1.
  radiusBottom — Radius of the cylinder at the bottom. Default is 1.
  height — Height of the cylinder. Default is 1.
  radialSegments — Number of segmented faces around the circumference of the cylinder. Default is 8
  heightSegments — Number of rows of faces along the height of the cylinder. Default is 1.
  openEnded — A Boolean indicating whether the ends of the cylinder are open or capped. Default is false, meaning capped.
  thetaStart — Start angle for first segment, default = 0 (three o'clock position).
  thetaLength — The central angle, often called theta, of the circular sector. The default is 2*Pi, which makes for a complete cylinder.
